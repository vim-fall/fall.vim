Fall is a fuzzy finder for Vim and Neovim, implemented in [Denops], and stands
for **"Filter All."**

See [Features](https://github.com/vim-fall/fall.vim/wiki/Features) for more
information about Fall's features.

> [!WARNING]
>
> This is a beta version. Please be aware that there might be
> backward-incompatible changes.

[Denops]: https://github.com/vim-denops/denops.vim

## Requirements

Users must install [Deno] version 2.x. Additionally, the `nerdfont` renderer is
enabled by default, so configure your terminal to use a [NerdFont], or disable
it by removing the `builtin.renderer.nerdfont` renderer from the custom file and
use non `builtin.theme.modern.MODERN_THEME` theme (`:FallCustom`).

[Deno]: https://deno.land
[NerdFont]: https://www.nerdfonts.com

Note that Deno version 1.x is not tested and not supported.

## Installation

To install [Denops] and this plugin using your preferred plugin manager, such as
[vim-plug], add the following lines to your Vim configuration:

```vim
Plug 'vim-denops/denops.vim'
Plug 'vim-fall/fall.vim'
```

## Usage

Use the `:Fall` command to open the fuzzy finder. The command accepts the
following arguments:

```
Fall {source} {source_args}...
```

For example, if you'd like to use the `file` source, you can use the following:

```
Fall file
```

Or use the `line` source with `README.md` as an argument:

```
Fall line README.md
```
